      This project created with a video of me and dad sea kayaking in South Korea. <br>
      I first started by editing the video to less than 15 seconds, and I added looping so that video will continue to play. <br>
      After that, I created functions drawing ellipses on both darkest and the brightest points of the video. <br>
      Then, I created a pixel filter and created a slight, translucent mirror effect with rectangles to accompany to beautiful waves and the sky. <br>
